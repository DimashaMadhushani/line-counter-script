# 📄 Line Counter Script

## 🛠️ What Does This Script Do?
This Python script takes a file as input and counts the number of lines in it. The result is saved in a log file with a human-readable timestamp.  
The script is designed to handle any file type (assuming it's plain text) but will not crash if given a structured file.

## 🚀 How to Run the Script
### **Running the Script Directly**
1. Ensure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Open PowerShell and navigate to the project directory:
   ```powershell
   cd D:\creately
